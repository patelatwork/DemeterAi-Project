# 🌱 Demeter AI: Smart Farming Solutions 🚜

Agriculture faces numerous challenges including unpredictable weather, soil degradation, and plant diseases that reduce crop yields and impact food security. **Demeter AI** bridges the gap between traditional farming and advanced technologies by providing AI-powered tools for crop management.

## 🔍 The Problem

Farming is becoming increasingly complex due to:
* **Limited access to expert advice** for small-scale farmers
* **Inefficiency in crop selection** based on local conditions
* **Lack of knowledge about appropriate fertilizers** for specific soil and crops
* **Delayed disease detection** leading to reduced productivity

## ✨ Features

### 1. 🌾 Crop Recommendation
